    <link>https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/index.html</link>
    <description>The Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) is an initiative by COVESA to define a syntax and a catalog for vehicle signals. The source code and releases can be found in the VSS github repository. Some tools for parsing and converting VSS files can be found in the VSS-tools github repository.&#xA;This documentation gives you an overview of VSS:&#xA;Introduction Read this part if you want to know more about what the specification is all about, whatâ€™s in and out and how to quickly browse through the current status.</description>

      <description>Governance The Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) project is an initiative by COVESA to define a syntax and a catalog for vehicle signals.&#xA;The artifacts maintained by the VSS project consist of:&#xA;Source code, documentation and releases in the VSS github repository. Tools for parsing and converting VSS files in the VSS-tools github repository. The VSS project has an informal structure with a chair and github maintainers appointed by COVESA. Tasks for the chair includes hosting regular meeting to discuss incoming pull requests and issues, as well as roadmap and release planning.</description>

      <description>The Rule Set of a domain taxonomy is used to describe how to write the data definition syntactically.&#xA;This chapter defines and describes the rule set for VSS. Tools in the vss-tools repository can be used to validate that a specification follows the rule set for VSS, but those tools may have limitations and may not check all rules stated in this document. In case of conflict, what is stated in the rule set in this documentation is considered to have precedence over tool implementations.</description>
