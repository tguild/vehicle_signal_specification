The overall goal of the Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS)  is to create a common understanding of vehicle signals in order to reach a “common language” independent of the protocol or serialisation format.

Please find the official documentation at: [Vehicle Signal Specification](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/)

## Getting started

### Using VSS
To use a specific version of VSS in your toolchain, head over to our [releases page](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification/releases/).


[Latest release](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification/releases/latest)

### Discuss all things VSS, "meet" the community

The community has regular calls to discuss topics around VSS.
This includes specific tickets in this repository as well as the broader direction in which VSS is evolving.
You can find current call coordinates and dates in [our wiki](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification/wiki/Weekly-meeting#meeting).


### Contribute to VSS

Work towards the next version is continuously ongoing in the [master branch](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification/tree/master)

To work with the specification directly, you need to clone this repository.

This repository uses git submodules.  Please make sure you clone recursively,

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification
```


Alternatively, just init and update the submodules after the initial cloning:

```
git clone https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification
git submodule update --init
```

### VSS version and release handling

Both VSS (this repository) and [VSS-tools](https://github.com/COVESA/vss-tools) use a [PEP](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/)
inspired version scheme. Artifacts generated by the [Makefile](Makefile) gets version from the file [VERSION](VERSION)
resulting in artifact names of the form `vss_rel_<version>.<type-suffix>` where `<version>` typically is `X.Y` or `X.Y.Z`
for released versions and `X.Y-dev` for ongoing work in master-branch towards version `X.Y`.

Version is also visible in the [Vehicle.vspec](spec/Vehicle/Vehicle.vspec) file where `VersionVSS.Label` typically is
`dev` for ongoing work in master-branch and an empty string for released versions.

Versions are tagged in the form `vX.Y(.Z)` and the same syntax is used as names for VSS releases.
VSS-tools is tagged but not released.
For release candidates the form `vX.YrcN` is used. The `rcN` suffix is not used in [VERSION](VERSION) and
[Vehicle.vspec](spec/Vehicle/Vehicle.vspec) files.

For more information on how versions are managed see the [Release Instruction](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification/wiki/Release-Instructions-and-Checklist)
