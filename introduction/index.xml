      <description>What is VSS? The Vehicle Signal Specification introduces a domain taxonomy for vehicle signals. In short this means that VSS introduces:&#xA;A syntax for defining vehicle signals in a structured manner. A catalog of signals related to vehicles. It can be used as standard in automotive applications to communicate information around the vehicle, which is semantically well defined. It focuses on vehicle signals, in the sense of classical attributes, sensors and actuators with the raw data communicated over vehicle buses and data which is more commonly associated with the infotainment system alike.</description>

      <description>The figure below explains the idea of a taxonomy as bridge between human and machine understanding of data. It is important to focus on a specific domain to get common understanding and acceptance. The link between two or more domain taxonomies can be seen as second step.&#xA;Components of a domain taxonomy A domain taxonomy, like VSS, consists of three important components, which will be discussed in detail in this documentation:</description>
